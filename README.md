Module 1 - HTML Assignments of Full Stack Development Course by Talent Battle

1. Create a static webpage using table tags of HTML.
2. Create a static web page which defines all text formatting tags of HTML in 
tabular format.
3. Create a webpage using list tags of HTML.
4. Create webpage to include image using HTML tag.
5. Create employee registration webpage using HTML form objects.
6. Create an HTML file (e.g. first_page.html) that specifies a page that contains 
a heading and two paragraphs of text. Use the HTML tags <h1>, </h1>, <p> 
and </p> in this exercise. As the texts in the heading and paragraphs you can 
use any texts you like.
Add an unordered list to this web page.
An unordered list can be specified with the tags <ul> and </ul>.
An unordered list typically contains a number of list items that can be 
specified with tags <li> and </li>.
After you have created your unordered list, check out what happens 
when you convert it to an ordered list by replacing the tags <ul> and </ul> with 
<ol> and </ol>, respectively.
Add an image to your web page. In this exercise you must use the 
<img> tag. As an image, you can use any .jpg or .png file you find on the 
Internet.
7. Create another .html file that contains a heading and a couple of paragraphs. 
You could name this new file another_page.html, and you should place it into 
the same folder where your first .html is. After you have created the new .html 
page, add a link to the first page so that the browser will load another_page.html 
when you click the text Go to the other page. in the first page. You need to use 
the <a> and </a> tags in this exercise. Inside the tag <a> you need to use a
href attribute that specifies which page will be loaded when the link is clicked.
8. HTML tags like <a> can have certain attributes. The href attribute is 
mandatory in the <a> tag. Additionally, it is possible to use the title attribute 
which specifies a text that emerges when the mouse cursor is moved above a 
link. This kind of text is called a tool tip. Modify the link that you created in the 
previous exercise so that a tool tip says "This leads you to another page." when 
the mouse cursor is over the link.
9. It is possible to use a picture (image) as a link. Modify your page so that the 
picture that is on your page will also serve as a link that leads to another page.
